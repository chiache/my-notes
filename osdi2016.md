**Push-Button Verification of File Systems via Crash Refinement**<br/>
*Helgi Sigurbjarnarson, James Bornholt, Emina Torlak, and Xi Wang, University of Washington*

Best Paper<br/>
Verify a file system implementation from its specification immediately (takes around 1~3 sec) as the users request. No manual proofs. xv6 + ext4 as an example. Cool demo--eating their own dog food.

**Intermittent Computation without Hardware Support or Programmer Intervention**<br/>
*Joel Van Der Woude, Sandia National Laboratories; Matthew Hicks, University of Michigan*

The background and problem being targetted is very intriguing and unique. When the power source is unstable, how to maintain the consitency of execution. Instrument the source code (c) to inject checkpoint between potentially re-ordered expressions to enforce crash consistency. Checkpont overhead up to 3-4x (SHA).
